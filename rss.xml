            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ursula K. Le Guin on Being a Man</h1><p>Who are we when we, to borrow Hannah Arendt's enduring words, "are together with no one but ourselves"? However much we might exert ourselves on learning to stop letting others define us, the definitions continue to be hurled at us - definitions predicated on who we should be in relation to some concrete or abstract other, some ideal, some benchmark beyond the boundaries of who we already are.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/77b607d680a8ee7d28a3795e61874a86741ce9a6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The History Manifesto: How to Eradicate the Epidemic of Short-Termism and Harness Our Past in Creating a Flourishing Future</h1><p>I spend a significant amount of time on ideas at the intersection of the timeless and the timely, something I find to be of growing urgency in a culture such as ours, where the tyrannical reverse-chronology of newsfeeds implies that the latest, being literally at the top, is also of the greatest importance and meaning.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c63d4609499ac59c77ff307c4046a6066e7d7b02.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Laborers Who Keep Dick Pics and Beheadings Out of Your Facebook Feed</h1><p>The campuses of the tech industry are famous for their lavish cafeterias, cushy shuttles, and on-site laundry services. But on a muggy February afternoon, some of these companies' most important work is being done 7,000 miles away, on the second floor of a former elementary school at the end of a row of auto mechanics' stalls in Bacoor, a gritty Filipino town 13 miles southwest of Manila.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e96d68b409f4633bcdac70d003ea4822946f9d4b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>frog</h1><p>Without context, sensing data tells an incomplete story. As humans, we are driven to seek ever-deeper understandings of both the world around us and the world within us. A growing number of us do just that by tracking the hours we sleep, the calories we eat, the miles we run, and many other types of inputs, states, and measures of performance.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/43deff52b7351c62d1d012feccc03ac99db3fb4e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Rethinking Segmentation for the New Digital Consumer</h1><p>Apple's launch this week of Apple Pay, its m-commerce product, could help finally move millions of mainstream consumers toward the promise of mobile payments, according to media reports. Given that Apple Pay will expose user preferences for payments and sharing data, this is a good time for companies to re-think how they segment their digital consumers, writes Mobiquity president Scott Snyder in this opinion piece.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/95392edcb8d2f2a56e838d24bad4a7836e2fc9de.jpg"></article>]]></description>
