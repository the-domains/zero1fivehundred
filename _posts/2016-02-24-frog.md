description: 'Without context, sensing data tells an incomplete story. As humans, we are driven to seek ever-deeper understandings of both the world around us and the world within us. A growing number of us do just that by tracking the hours we sleep, the calories we eat, the miles we run, and many other types of inputs, states, and measures of performance.'
